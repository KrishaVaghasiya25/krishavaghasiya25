## 👩‍💻 About Me
I am currently a Diploma IT student in my final semester.  
I am learning programming fundamentals and building small projects to improve my skills.

I focus on **understanding concepts clearly**, practicing regularly, and improving my code gradually instead of rushing to advanced topics.

## 📘 Learning Approach
I learn programming by:
- Editing and experimenting with code
- Testing small changes to understand how things work
- Breaking code and fixing it to learn from mistakes
- Improving existing projects step by step rather than starting everything from scratch

This helps me build confidence and real understanding over time.
